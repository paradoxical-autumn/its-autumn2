                <p>Heya! I'm autumn <em class="subtext rambling">(aka paradoxical-autumn or paradox or
                        justAnotherParadox or paradox19... i have so many pseudonyms, they continue...)</em></p>
                <p>I'm a programmer and musician from the UK who likes messing around with technology.</p>

                <p>Outside of that, I enjoy photography, drawing, 3D animating, graphics design and trying my hand at
                    new creative tasks. Recently, I've actually been messing around with a technique called Gaussian
                    Splatting - a technique to 3D scan environments and reconstruct them with Gaussians (little blurred
                    circles). If I ever make a gallery of pictures on this website, I'll upload some screenshots there.
                </p>

                <p>Ever since I was a young person, I've been fascinated by the digital world mainly thanks to
                    unrestricted internet access. Oh god. However, I'll admit that it made me into the person I am today
                    and I can't say it'd be better if I hadn't had it.</p>

                <h2 id="music">Music</h2>
                <p>My love of music started when I was extremely young. Apparently, when I was probably 2 I was dancing
                    to the anthems of the time and trying my best to create music with whatever I could find. Maybe when
                    I was about 7, my dad had introduced me to an old app called "launchpad" (I think that was the name)
                    which allowed me to create quick loops of music using premade samples. By the time I was 10, I was
                    messing with the demo for FL Studio and, well... not getting very far as I wasn't allowed to
                    download random files onto the family computer. <i>Y'know, "random files" includes virtual
                        instruments so I was basically stuck with the default set in FL at the time.</i></p>

                <h2 id="furry">FURRY TRASH</h2>
                <em>take a shot every time you see the word "furry" or some variation of it in here.</em>
                <p>Yeah, I might be one. Just maybe. It's not that important though. I don't commonly associate with the
                    fandom, I just choose to represent myself online as my character. I found out about furries in 2019
                    when some of my (now also furry) friends were hating on furries as a whole and I, in my innocence,
                    had no idea what a furry was. So, I asked them about it and heard a horribly incorrect ramble about
                    what they are and thought "no that can't be right..."</p>

                <p>That night, I went on the internet, looked into what furries are and <em>OhNoWhatHaveIDone</em>. The
                    next day, I had a protogen OC. However, I abandoned that character in 2022 when I made my second
                    character, "autumn" (I'll get back to that name later) who was my first "official" fursona (I hate
                    typing that word.) 2023 happened and I made my second - much more recognisable - character, Paradox
                    (hey I wonder why that name sounds familiar).</p>

                <p>Oh and to the uneducated people, I'm not one of the "weird" <em>(up to your definition)</em> furries.
                    I don't do/watch/look at/partake in/whatever else anything /bad/, I just simply exist with weird
                    animal characters.
                </p>

                <h2 id="resonite">Resonite</h2>
                <p>At the end of 2023, I found a quirky little VR game called Resonite. Most people would compare it to
                    VRChat as they're both social VR games but Resonite has a larger focus on tinkering and creating
                    things. You literally create the worlds, avatars, items, whatever else in game and with other users
                    if you want.</p>

                <h2 id="names">Names</h2>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 2lh;">This is <em>not</em> a list of all the usernames I use but rather a
                    paragraph about the name "autumn" and why I mentioned it earlier.</p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 2lh;">...</p>
                <p>nah screw that actually. Basically, I create the character but realised <i>I</i> wanted the name blah
                    blah blah gender stuff happened xD and now that character is without a name and idk what to name
                    them again xD</p>
