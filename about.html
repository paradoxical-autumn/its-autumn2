        <p>Heya! I'm autumn <em
                class="subtext rambling">(aka
                paradoxical-autumn or paradox or justAnotherParadox or paradox19... i have so many pseudonyms, they
                continue...)</em></p>
        <p>I'm a programmer and musician from the UK who likes messing around with technology.</p>

        <p>Outside of that, I enjoy photography, drawing, 3D animating, graphics design and trying my hand at new
            creative tasks. Recently, I've actually been messing around with a technique called Gaussian Splatting - a
            technique to 3D scan environments and reconstruct them with Gaussians (little blurred circles).
            If I ever make a gallery of pictures on this website, I'll upload some screenshots there.</p>

        <p>Ever since I was a young person, I've been fascinated by the digital world mainly thanks to unrestricted
            internet access. Oh god. However, I'll admit that it made me into the person I am today and I can't say it'd
            be better if I hadn't had it.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>My love of music started when I was extremely young. Apparently, when I was probably 2 I was dancing to the
            anthems of
            the time and trying my best to create music with whatever I could find. Maybe when I was about 7, my dad had
            introduced me to an old app called "launchpad" (I think that was the name) which allowed me to create quick
            loops of music using premade samples. By the time I was 10, I was messing with the demo for FL Studio and,
            well... not getting very far as I wasn't allowed to download random files onto the family computer.
            <i>Y'know,
                "random files" includes virtual instruments so I was basically stuck with the default set in FL at the
                time.</i>
        </p>

        <h2>FURRY TRASH</h2>
        <em>take a shot every time you see the word "furry" or some variation of it in here.</em>
        <p>Yeah, I might be one. Just maybe. It's not that important though. I don't commonly associate with the
            fandom, I just choose to represent myself online as my character. I found out about furries in 2019 when
            some of my (now also furry) friends were hating on furries as a whole and I, in my innocence, had no idea
            what a furry was. So, I asked them about it and heard a horribly incorrect ramble about what they are and
            thought "no that can't be right..."</p>

        <p>That night, I went on the internet, looked into what furries are and <em>OhNoWhatHaveIDone</em>. The next
            day, I had
            a protogen OC. However, I abandoned that character in 2022 when I made my second character, "autumn" (I'll
            get back to that name later) who was my first "official" fursona (I hate typing that word.) 2023 happened
            and I made my second - much more recognisable - character, Paradox (hey I wonder why that name sounds
            familiar).</p>

        <p>Oh and to the uneducated people, I'm not one of the "weird" <em>(up to your definition)</em> furries. I don't
            do/watch/look at/partake in/whatever else anything /bad/, I just simply exist with weird animal characters.
        </p>

        <h2>Resonite</h2>
        <p>At the end of 2023, I found a quirky little VR game called Resonite. Most people would compare it
            to VRChat as they're both social VR games but Resonite has a larger focus on tinkering and creating things.
            You literally create the worlds, avatars, items, whatever else in game and with other users if you want.</p>
        </p>

        <h2>Names</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 2lh;">This is <em>not</em> a list of all the usernames I use but rather a paragraph
            about the name "autumn" and why I mentioned it earlier.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 2lh;">...</p>
        <p>nah screw that actually. Basically, I create the character but realised <i>I</i> wanted the name blah blah
            blah gender stuff happened xD and now that character is without a name and idk what to name them again xD
