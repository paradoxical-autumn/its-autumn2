                            it'll get clipped by most modern browsers. God I hate writing about myself. Seriously, who's
                            idea was this? Idk. Go ask ▙▞▄▙░▝, they wanted to make the site and literally named half of
                            it after themself. Why am I still here and why do I need to play a character seriously this
                            is MY WEBSITE all these idiots just exist merely inside of my brain. "but if you're the
                            webmaster then who's the architects??" LORE. ofc i actually take on all roles but for the
                            purposes of lore I literally roleplay each part of it. I mean not really, there are some
                            other people but they aren't named unless they want to be. they also stole this joke and the
                            whole idea of a character page from em essex. go check them out https://msx.horse
