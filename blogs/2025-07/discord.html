                <h1>discord</h1>
                <p>oh boy, discord. man, i sure do <em>love</em> that platform.</p>
                <p>yeah, i dont know what to write here but this is kinda a <em>major<span class="subtext">?</span></em>
                    update on my life, especially to people i talk to a lot.</p>
                <p>so, to my friends, as you're probably aware, my discord account is in a... frozen state right now.
                    the account simply says "autumn [probably not coming back]" or something like that.</p>
                <p>the truth is ive been thinking about leaving discord for a while and was only recently pushed to do
                    it by multiple stressors pressuring me at once on it. i was originally just gonna leave for a day to
                    recover, but then the funniest thing happened.</p>

                <h1 id="ntft">not the first time</h1>
                <p>a few of you are probably aware that this isn't the first time ive nuked my presence on the platform.
                    its more like the third. i get myself into a cycle of:</p>
                <pre>1. EVERYTHING'S FINE!
2. OH BOY THINGS ARE GETTING SLIGHTLY WORSE.
3. OH NO. THEYRE MUCH WORSE.
4. &lt;This content has been removed.&gt;
5. LET'S DISABLE DISCORD FOR NOW...
6. OH HEY! EVERYTHING'S FINE!</pre>
                <p>its not the smartest. so, ive decided to disable my account pretty much permanently until i manage to
                    get myself entirely better, but, this is where that funny thing i mentioned earlier comes into play.
                </p>
                <p>so, you know how i say my mental health improves when i stay off the platform for a while? well, what
                    if... i just stayed off of it!</p>

                <h1 id="why">why??</h1>
                <p>ive got plenty of reasons "why" i want to avoid this hellhole - and ive already alluded to a few -
                    but, ill detail them anyway</p>

                <h2>stressors & fearful symmetry</h2>
                <p>my main issue with discord is the great number of stressors that follow me everywhere on it, whether
                    it be the feeling like i <em>need</em> to reply to people as soon as im online, or because people
                    are just being wankers. the stressors follow me everywhere on it.</p>
                <p>one of the most recent - and intense - incidents was a repeat of something that happened to me 5
                    years ago (IRL) which led to a ▟▘▜▟▛▜▒ PTSD diagnosis. again, <em><b>that was irl</b></em> and it
                    sounds petty as ▟░▚▙ because "wah you got upset over discord"</p>
                <p>if you belive that that's petty: imagine showing a soldier with PTSD pictures of a war, theyre not
                    gonna like it, but "wahh!! theyre just pictures!!! you shouldnt be upset!!"</p>
                <p>now, you see my argument.</p>
                <p>anyway, i'll skirt around the point here but something ocurred amongst one of my closest friend
                    groups that was fearfully similar to something that happened in my life previously and blah blah
                    blah PTSD whatever.</p>
                <p>so, out of my own wellbeing i disabled my own access to discord for that day. not my account but
                    simply my access to it. it was only meant to last a day.</p>
                <p>but, yknow, ive since realised how much of a burden the platform is on me! so ive decided to extend
                    my hiatus indefinitely.</p>
                <p>anyway, ive still got other reasons i want to avoid this hellscape.</p>

                <h2>enshittification</h2>
                <p>...i dont have much to write here, i used to be a paying discord nitro subscriber but unsubscribed
                    due to recent choices by the company i cannot support. and holy shit, the platform is borderline
                    unusable for my usecase. i need to upload larger files quite often for things like clients, but
                    yknow!! gotta pay discord 10 eurollands a month for that!</p>
                <p>i understand i could just host my files on something like <a href="https://1024cats.social"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1024c</a> and that <em>is</em> what ive been doing for
                    ages, but holy shit does that get painful sometimes.</p>

                <h1 id="conclusion">conclusion</h1>
                <p>i get a lot of this shit is really petty and, quite frankly, <em>▚▄▗▝▟▗▖ stupid</em>. but its had an
                    affect on me i cannot explain, that plus all the fearful symmetry i mentioned earlier.</p>
                <p>so, im probably gonna be avoiding discord for now like its the plague. if you need me, there's plenty
                    of other contact options on the <a href="/">root of this website.</a> though, id recommend matrix.
                    its slightly more bearable than discord due to the lack of enshittification.</p>
                <p>though, i am aware that if i use that like discord, well, ill be relapsing again.</p>
                <p>so yeah, thats why im not using discord.</p>
                <p>id usually end these with some hopeful ramble but i dont think its worth it here.</p>
                <p>therefore, good morning / afternoon / goodnight / whatever your timezone is. ttyl.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 3rem;">PS: if you're a friend reading this and want to talk to me over this, don't
                    dm me on discord ◑﹏◐</p>
                <p>...that should go without saying. ive already had 4 people try and dm me on discord after hearing
                    this news. im not going to respond!</p>
