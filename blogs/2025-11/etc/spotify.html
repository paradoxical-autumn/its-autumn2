    <p>another artist i like, Halley Labs, put it best:</p>
    <p>the issues raised here apply to <i>most</i> distribution platforms, not just spotify, but spotify is the worst
        offender</p>

    <p>if you don't like reading: here's a 40 minute video documentary about music distribution:</p>

    <p>the following is sourced from: https://msx.horse/faq.php</p>
    <p>// why isn't your music on spotify?</p>
    <p>spotify is an ecosystem designed to over-convenience you, undervalue music as a result, and keep you bound to its
        service. it is not a place for art, for authorship, for anything. it is a place where music is "content" and
        listeners are "product." it is an unsustainable nightmare that can only serve to erode the very thing it
        suggests it provides - music - though realistically, it is not concerned with providing that.</p>

    <p>i am aware your phone might not have much storage on it, but surely you have a couple GB free? maybe cycle albums
        out each week, really get to know the stuff on your hard drive. hell, maybe have stuff on your hard drive at
        home at
        all, in a place where it can actually be there when you're counting on it. something you can back up and keep
        for a
        long while, not relying on it simply continuing to exist in the ether of streaming. if you don't have a couple
        GB
        free, maybe look into a cheap used MP3 player? or maybe a CD player, and you can burn discs? or maybe one of
        those
        CD-MP3 players, where you can burn discs full of hundreds of MP3s. lots of options.</p>

    <p>oh, but also:</p>
